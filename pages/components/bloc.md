        <h1>Bloc graphical stack</h1>
        <p class="lead">Glamorous Toolkit is built on top of the Bloc vector-based graphical framework. The key property is that it relies on exactly one rendering tree at all times without the need of an intermediate canvas. This enables new kinds of visual interfaces, including a live and rich text editor and complicated visual scenes.</p>
