            <a href="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">Developers spend 50% or more of their time figuring systems out</a>. It's the single most expensive activity in software development. And most of it is spent on reading. We reimagine it from the ground up, and with it we reshape the whole development experience. We call it moldable development.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Every single development problem includes a data science problem, and data problems are best dealt with custom tools.
            Glamorous Toolkit makes this practical through a platform that makes the creation of tools inexpensive.

            Moldable development has many implications both technically and economically. And it can make you smile when you work, too.

            Figuring systems out is expensive and pervasive. Not doing it well ends up creating black boxes that pile up on top of each other. As the world we build is based on software, we cannot let it remain a black box. It's a large problem that can only change if we deal with it explicitly. We need a conversation.</p>

        <p class="lead">Every part of a software system, be it an algorithm, a domain-driven design, or the architecture, can be made explainable through custom tools. 
          Glamorous Toolkit makes this possible by treating the interface as a set of visual and interactive operators that can be combined in many ways. </p>
