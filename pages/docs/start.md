        <h2>Install and run</h2>
        <p>
          First things, first. Please go ahead and <a href="/install" class="btn btn-lg btn-default">install Glamorous Toolkit</a>. We'll wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is what just happened. You downloaded a self contained installation made of a Glamorous Toolkit image, a virtual machine, and a few other resources and libraries. The contents of the folder should look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/pictures/gtr-distribution-contents.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, run the image with the virtual machine and you are good to go.
        </p>
        <h2>Browse</h2>
        <p>
          Ok, so back to your installation. It should now be running and look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/pictures/gtr-home.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now what? Start by reading the Glamorous Toolkit Book that is shipped right in the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/pictures/gtr-book.png"/>
        </p>
        <h2>Pharo hello world</h2>
        <p>
          Open a Playground and type:
        </p>
        <pre>'Hello world'</pre>
        <p>
          Now press this <img src="/assets/pictures/gt-playinspect.png"/> button, and you should see this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/pictures/gtr-hello-world-inspector.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it. You executed a piece of code and you are now inspecting the resulting object. Did you expect to rather print the result on some console?  That's possible, but we do it very rarely because inspectors are much more interesting. Programming with Glamorous Toolkit is about working with a live system. So, really, dive into the environment and let us know what you think.
