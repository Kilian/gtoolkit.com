        <h1>Analyzing software systems</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Glamorous Toolkit also comes with an elaborate software analysis framework.
        </p>
        <h2>What do we mean by software analysis?</h2>
        <p>Take a look at this picture:</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/pictures/gtr-importing-cpp-blueprint-ast.png"/></p>
        <p>We see three panes. First, we have a model of a system that can be queried. The model offers a deeply connected graph of the various entities. In our example, we see a blueprint visualization of the internals of a C++ class. Furthermore, we can go a step further and get to the details of the abstract syntax tree of any entity.</p>
        <p>This is but an example. In essence, we represent various facts about systems as objects that we can manipulate through the inspector interface in many different ways.</p>
        <h2>Programmable analyses</h2>
        <p>Software systems are highly contextual and because of that we can predict classes of problems, but not the specific problems that developers might have. For an analysis to be effective, it has to capture the specifics of the system. It needs to be contextualized.</p>
