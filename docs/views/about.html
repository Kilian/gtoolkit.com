          Do you love working with legacy systems?
        </p>

        <p>
          When we ask people involved in software development, we typically get a decided "No," often accompanied by a visible shiver. And that's at the core of our mission. We want to make legacy systems feel worth of human attention and energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          How should or could we do that?
        </p>

        <p>
          "As a developer, do you read code for at least 50% of your time?" is another question we are asking. The answer is overwhelmingly "Yes". But, when we ask "when was the last time you heard others talk about how they read code?," the reaction is one of surprise. In other words, we do not talk about it. "50% of more" makes this the single most expensive activity. And we never talk about it. We think this has to change, too.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason people read code is so that they understand enough to figure out what to do next. That activity is called decision making, and this menas that reading is the way we retrieve information ouf of data. Oh yes, code is data. We will get to this a little later. Back to reading. If reading is a way to retrieve information, we should entertain the idea of another way, especially given that reading is the slowest poasible way to crawl through data.
