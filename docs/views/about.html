          "Do you love working on legacy systems?" is a question we asked people involved in software development. We typically get a decided "No," often accompanied by a visible shiver. We think this has to change.

          "As a developer, do you read code for at least 50% of your time?" is another question we are asking. The answer is overwhelmingly "Yes". But, when we ask "when was the last time you heard others talk about how they read code?," the reaction is one of surprise. In other words, we do not talk about "50% of more" makes this the single most expensive activity.
