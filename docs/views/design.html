        <h2>Moldable first</h2>
        <p>
          Software is shapeless. Yet, to reason about it we, humans, need a shape. Tools provide the shape of software. It follows that tools are essential. But, software is also highly contextual. For tools to be effective, they have to take that context into account. It follows that tools must be moldable so that the programmer can adapt them to the current needs.
        </p>

        <h2>"I" stands for integrated</h2>
        <p>
          An integrated environment is one that supports all activities required for evolving a software system. That means that every time we leave the environment to reason about our own system, the “I” has failed. We should not have to leave.

        <h2>Uniform visual and interaction language over features</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Visualization is a first class citizen</h2>
        <p>
          Software is data. And data has no shape. Or better yet, it has no one shape. It has many.  That’s why visual depiction of data must be a first class citizen.
        </p>

        <h2>Color is for data</h2>
        <p>
          Color is a powerful visual tool. We want it used for what matters. The code. The data.
        </p>

        <h2>No modal dialogs</h2>
        <p>
          Just that. No modal dialogs. Because our brains have better things to do.

        <h2>One rendering tree</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Text is made of regular elements</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>All layouts are regular layouts</h2>
        <p>
          Ok, this is a nerdy one, but one that we are quite proud of. To achieve one rendering tree, all layouts must be regular layouts. Including the graph layouts. And all this without imposing a specific structure to the elements.
