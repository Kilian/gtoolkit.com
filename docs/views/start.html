        <h2>Install and run</h2>
        <p>
          First things, first. Please go ahead and <a href="#install" class="btn btn-lg btn-default">install Glamorous Toolkit</a>. We'll wait.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, here is what just happened. You downloaded a self contained installation made of a Glamorous Toolkit image, a Pharo virtual machine, and a few other things. Run the image with the virtual machine and you are good to go.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Pharo and how does Glamorous Toolkit fit with it?</h2>

        <p>
          Yes, that's a legitimate question. Pharo is a Smalltalk language and environment. That means that you have a very tight integration between the language and the development environment. Pharo already comes with a development environment. Glamorous Toolkit offers a novel alternative environment based on a completely new graphical stack.
        </p>

        <h2>Browse</h2>

        <p>
          Ok, so back to your installation. It should now be running and look like this:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="./pictures/gt-tour-initial.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
          Now what? Start by browsing. The first thing you see is the Glamorous Tour document. That's a live document. Go ahead. Click on the links. Read the tutorials. We just warn you that it's quite captivating. Better allocate a Pomodoro or two to not lose track of time.
        </p>


        <h2>Hello world</h2>
        <p>
          Open the GT Playground and type:
        </p>

        <pre>'Hello world'</pre>

        <p>
          Now press this <img src="./pictures/gt-playinspect.png"/> button, and you should see this:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="./pictures/gt-hello-world-inspector.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
          That's it. You executed a piece of code and you are now inspecting the resulting object. Did you expect to rather print the result on some console? That's possible as well. Execute and inspect:
        </p>

        <pre>transcript := GtTranscript new.
transcript show: 'Hello world'.</pre>

        <p>
          And you should get:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="./pictures/gt-hello-world-transcript.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, you created a transcript object, and told it to show the string. At the end you saw the result being printed in the transcript rendering. Did you still expect to see an example that prints this to the operating system console? That's possible as well, but let's stop here for now.
        </p>
